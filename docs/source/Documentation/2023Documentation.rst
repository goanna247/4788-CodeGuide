This year we have decided to build a high scoring robot which can intake from the ground and dock on the charging station. 
Programming is going to have a very big impact, if we can automate lots of these functions we will be able to drastically increase our cycle time, and make it easier for drivers.

Our robot priorities are: 
1. Reliable 
2. Fixable 
3. Robust 
4. Fast cycle time 
5. Mobility & Maneuverability
6. Stability 

Our Programming priorities are: 
1. Reliability 

Our subsystems this year are 
1. armavator (arm + elevator + gripper)
2. swerve drive 
3. intake + mag 
4. vision 

later in the season we will also be programming auto as a seperate subsystem
