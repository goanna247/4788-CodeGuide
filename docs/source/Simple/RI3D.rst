RI3D
=====

RI3D is a very short version of the main season, however we keep the programming very simple in order to help everyone 
on the team learn about the basics. 

Code should be structured in just 2 files (to start with), Robot.h and Robot.cpp

We start RI3D with deciding who is going to be programming what subsystem, usually a veteran and a rookie will pair up 
If there are spare people we assign the more experienced programmers to do more complex things like auto and vision. 

Liveshare is a very good method of working collaboratively on code together

Make your subsystem on a new branch called ``RI3D``

Code whatever you need to code (make sure you are communicating with others so that you dont use the same controls)

Push your code to your origin remote, then create a Pull request (refer to the github tab)

Viola/Anna/Jaci/Harry will merge your code into the main RI3D code, if the robot is already finished you can go test your code, or it will be tested once all the code has been merged together.
