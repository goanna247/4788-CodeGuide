Welcome to Team 4788's Software Guide! 
===================================

This is Team 4788's compendium of software knowledge, hopefully this collection of information will serve as a good resource
for developing robot code. 

This is not a programming tutorial, this is an FRC guide, if you need refreshers on programming concepts please go back to the pre-season slides (or just ask a mentor)

The table of contents is laid out in a cronological order, if you are new to FRC programming start with the :doc:`Installation` section for information 
on how to set-up your computer for the upcoming season. 

then move onto :doc:`Simple Code Guide + RI3D` which serves as an introduction to simple FRC code, including controllers, motor controllers, ect. It 
features a very simple structure of code using 2 files (Robot.h and Robot.cpp) which is what you will use during RI3D, and any very quick prototype tests. 

:doc:`Robot Code` describes our main season code, including structure, formatting, how to use behaviours, more complex code and idea's. 

:doc:`Github` Is a reminder of how to use git.

:doc:`Wombat` Is more comprehensive documentation for the Wombat library, which has a number of very useful functions. 

:doc:`2023 Documentation` is our documentation for the upcoming season, will be updated as the season continues.
