Auto 
------

Autonomous is a combination of programming and strategy decisions. 
The strategy will be done by the entire programming team + some of the rest of the team, this includes things like 
how many balls to fire, which balls to fire, what paths to run, ect. 

The start of programming autonomous is path planning, since this can be done without the subsystems being completed. 

Wombat has a number of features that make autonomous a whole lot easier.
